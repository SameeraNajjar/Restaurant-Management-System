# Restaurant-Management-System

Project Overview

The Restaurant Management System is a Java-based application designed to streamline food ordering operations, including table reservations and order management. The system provides functionalities for user registration and login, table reservations, order management, and menu management. It is built using Java and JavaFX for the graphical user interface (GUI).

This project is developed as part of a semester-long assignment, where each student is responsible for implementing specific features and ensuring continuous integration using GitLab (or similar version control systems). The application adheres to design patterns and best practices to ensure scalability and maintainability.
